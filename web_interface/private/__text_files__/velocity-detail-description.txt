The Developer Velocity shows the performance of you and your team.
The graph shows your developer velocity in relation to the average developer velocity of your team.
The Velocity should be constant. A drop in developer velocity should have a reason. A good reason would be the team trying a new way to estimate tasks.
If the estimation is off the velocity changes. Another good reason would be the assignment of new responsibilities. If a developer is distracted the performance can drop.

When the teams velocity drops with no good reason, your teams has problems. This is a very important indicator and most likely originates in bad code leading to problems.
We recommend that the teams spends more time writing good code.

On the other hand if the velocity is up it might be that the developers are not spending enough time keeping the code clean.
This means your team pushes pad code into master and pretty soon the velocity will drop because the bad code is blocking development.
This will slow your team down in the long run. We recommend you spend more time cleaning your code.
