The Developer Velocity shows the performance of the team. The Velocity should be constant. When the developer velocity drops, your teams has problems. It could be that the team is no longer motivated. It could be that the estimations of the team are off, leading to a false velocity. It could be that new team members disrupt the team dynamic. In all cases is the code quality most likely dropping, which leads to false estimations for tasks that should take less to complete. We recommend you find out what the team is thinking. Talk about the parts of the code that need refactoring. On the other hand if the velocity is up it might be that the developers are not spending enough time keeping the code clean. This will slow your team down in the long run. We recommend you spend more time cleaning your code. Else you will see the velocity drop soon enough.
